# Standby-Script
A script for when you leave your setup and can't be bothered to turn off all your monitors manually. Instead of pressing external buttons, this script puts your PC into standby — your monitors turn off by themselves. Then, just move your mouse or press a key and everything’s back to normal. Perfect for anyone with multiple screens and no patience.
