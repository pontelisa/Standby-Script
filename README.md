# Turn Off Monitors with One Click

A simple Windows script that turns off your monitor(s) with a double click or shortcut. The monitors automatically turn back on when mouse movement or a key press is detected.


## Description

Perfect for those who don’t want to manually turn off each monitor: just run the script and the displays will switch off; any input (mouse/keyboard) instantly turns them back on.


## Features

- **Instantly turns off monitors** with a single click.
- **Automatically wakes them up** with any mouse or keyboard action.
- Compatible with Windows 10 and 11.
- Can easily be assigned to a **keyboard shortcut** or pinned to the taskbar for quick access.


## Quick Guide

1. Download the `.bat` file (`Standby.bat`).
2. Double-click to run — the monitors will turn off.
3. Any movement or key press will wake them up.


### (Optional) Shortcut or Hotkey

- Create a shortcut to the `.bat` file.
- In the shortcut’s properties, assign a key combination such as **Ctrl + Alt + N** to turn off the monitors without opening the file.
